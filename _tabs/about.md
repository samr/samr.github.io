Hello and welcome. I am never sure what to write here. I suppose I can say a few things about myself.

I have been writing code for decades, and perhaps strangely, I still enjoy it. My current foot-canon of choice is C++,
though I also dabble in Python, Rust, Lua and a variety of other languages.

I must be a bit of a masochist because I do the majority of my development in Neovim. I blame the twitch reflexes
developed early on in my career. I also, regrettably, spend far too much time trying to find the Platonic ideal of a vim
config.

I have a background in Computer Vision. However, I am currently not doing much of that in my day job (but occasionaly,
I do, which is fun). I find I am devoting more of my time to developing and building teams, which I find to be
challengeing, and also quite rewarding.

I hope to share some thoughts and adventures here, but fair warning, I'm not very consistent at putting out content.
